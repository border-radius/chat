// someone else's rooms), and a room kept for another user is never shown. What was kept is also held in memory while
// the page is open: switching back to a room shows it in the same task, without waiting for IndexedDB (or showing an
// empty room for a frame). A convenience, never an error: without IndexedDB (a private window, a browser that
