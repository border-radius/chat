# The client API

What the clients (web/, android/) rely on from the server. The Android app is installed and updated by its users, on
their own schedule (F-Droid), so a release of the server has to keep working with the apps already out there.
Anything listed here is a public interface. A change to it needs the compatibility check below, not just green
tests.

Shared values live in [`shared/contract.json`](../shared/contract.json): the field lists, limits and file types. Each
client keeps its own copy, and tests compare those copies with the contract:
- `tests/unit/contract.test.ts` checks the web's copy and the hooks' copy.
- `android/…/lib/ContractTest.kt` checks the app's.
- `tests/integration/schema.test.ts` checks the limits against the migrations.

Rules that more than one implementation must follow have test vectors in [`shared/vectors/`](../shared/vectors/):
- `text.json`, `jump.json`: text folding, search queries, Jump to's ranking. The web, the hooks and the app run them.
- `window.json`: the message window (merge, trim, pages, groups, page queries; DESIGN.md §7.5). The web
  (`tests/unit/lib/window-vectors.test.ts`) and the app (`WindowVectorsTest.kt`) run it. Messages in it are written out
  or generated as `tests/support/vectors.ts` says.
- `room.json`: the room controller against a real server (open, page, jump, go to, live messages, pill, unread line,
  deletes). Recorded from the web's controller (`RECORD=1 npx vitest run --project component
  tests/component/views/room/scenarios.test.ts`) and replayed by it and by the app's `RoomScenariosTest.kt`. A change to
  what the controller does is recorded again, then the app is made to pass.

## What the clients use

**Record API** (`/api/collections/{name}/records`). PocketBase's API rules decide access:

| Collection | Web | App | How |
|---|---|---|---|
| `users` | ✓ | ✓ | auth (password, refresh), sign-up, profile update (`fields.user`) |
| `rooms` | ✓ | ✓ | get, create, update (`fields.room`); list: apps before 2026-10-29, and the app with a server from before then |
| `messages` | ✓ | ✓ | get, create (multipart), update (`fields.message`); pages, search (`text_key ~`) and the notification check by filter: apps before 2026-10-29, and the app with a server from before then |
| `hidden_rooms` | ✓ | ✓ | list, create, delete (`fields.roomRow`) |
| `site` | ✓ | ✓ | the site record; the app also reads `min_android_version` |
| `collections`, `collection_items` | ✓ | ✓ | the collections pages (`fields.collectionItem`) |
| `push_tokens` | | delete only | apps from before ANDROID.md §21 unregister their Firebase token |

The clients send filters in PocketBase's filter syntax. Apps from before 2026-10-29 name the fields `room`, `created`,
`id`, `updated`, `files`, `forward_of`, `text_key`, `author`, `deleted`, `room.kind`, `reply_to.author` and
`collection`; apps from then on (with a current server) only `id` (users), `room` (`room_reads`, the live room),
`collection` and `owner` (collections). Renaming a field, changing its type or tightening a rule breaks the apps
already installed.

**Pages and the room list** are routes (`pb_hooks/lib/lists.js`), so a client names the page, not the filter:
`GET /api/chat/rooms` and `GET /api/chat/rooms/{room}/messages?kind=latest|first|older|newer|changed` (cursor
`created`, `id`; for `changed` `since`, `from`, `to`; `files=1`; `q`, search's words, which the server folds and
escapes; `limit` ≤ 200; `page`). The app's notification check is `GET /api/chat/notifiable?rooms=a,b&since=…&every=a`
(signed in; other people's DMs and replies to you, and every message of the `every` rooms; rooms you can't see left
out). All answer a plain array of
records, with `expand` and `fields` as the records API takes them, and see what its rules let the caller see (a room you can't
see has no messages). The app falls back to the records API when a route answers 404 (a server from before the
routes; it can talk to servers it doesn't control). `tests/integration/lists.test.ts` and `search.test.ts` check each
answer against the records API's answer for the filter it replaces; the app's `LegacyServerTest` runs the same session
against a current server and one without the routes (or an old release's hooks, `-Pchirkle.legacyHooks=…`).

**Custom routes** (`pb_hooks/main.pb.js`, `federation.pb.js`):
`/api/chat/rooms`, `rooms/{room}/messages`, `notifiable`, `dms`, `unread`, `unread/{room}`, `reads`, `reactions`, `delete`, `forward`, `media/{room}`,
`posters/{message}/{file}`, `posters/items/{item}/{file}`, `collections`, `badges`, `items`, `items/{id}`, `saved`,
`subs`, `subs/seen`, `users`, `password`, `remote-users`. Also `/api/files/*` (with a file token), `/api/health` and
`/.well-known/assetlinks.json`.

**Realtime** (`/api/realtime`): `rooms`, `messages` (one room's, or every room's with `fields.activity`),
`hidden_rooms`, `room_reads`, `collections`, `collection_subs`, `chat/badges` and `PB_CONNECT`.

Routes only the server or tests call: the `*/tick` routes (superusers), `/api/fed/*` (other instances, §33) and
`/api/telegram/webhook`.

## Changing it

- **Adding** a field, a route or an optional parameter is safe. Clients ask for named fields (`fields=`), so they
  never see a new field until they ask for it.
- **Renaming or removing** anything in the tables above: keep the old form working until no supported app version
  uses it. Then raise `site.min_android_version`, which tells older apps to update (ANDROID.md §12.4).
- **Tightening** a rule or a limit: older apps check against the old limit, so the server's own error message is
  what their users will see. It must still read well.
- A field list in `shared/contract.json` changes together with both clients' copies. The contract tests fail until
  all three match.
