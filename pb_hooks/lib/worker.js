// The cron workers' run loop (link previews §28, media §30.1, Telegram §26.7, federation §33.8): a cron job starts a
// run every minute and it goes on for most of that minute, a pass at a time. One run at a time, by a lock in the app
// store holding the run's own handle and when it was last renewed. A lock not renewed for `staleMs` was left by a run
// that died (or is stuck) and is taken over; the old run then stops at its next renew, and its unlock leaves the new
// run's lock alone (QA BUG-147). Passes renew after every item they handle (`renew`), so a slow item can't make the
// lock look stale while it is still being worked on (QA BUG-111).
//
// A worker whose work is queued by this server's own saves can say so (`wakes`): with nothing to do, its run then
// looks for work only when a save wakes it (`wake`, after the save is committed) and every IDLE_MS, not every
// second (docs/PERF.md). The pass every IDLE_MS finds what was queued some other way (a migration, raw SQL).
