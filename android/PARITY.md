# Parity with the web app

Each web e2e spec (`tests/e2e/`) and the Android tests that cover the same behaviour (ANDROID.md §13). A web feature
without an entry here fails review. **Covered**: the scenario runs on the app's screens (Robolectric, against a real
PocketBase). **Partial**: the behaviour is tested below the screens (API, services, room controller), or only some of
the spec's cases are. **Not yet**: no Android test.

Test classes: `UiFlowTest`, `UiFeaturesTest`, `UiPortsTest`, `UiCollectionsTest`, `UiNotifyTest`, `UiLinkedTest`, `RoutesTest` (`app/src/test`); `ServicesTest`, `ChirkleApiTest`, `CollectionsTest`, `NotifyCheckTest`, the
`lib` tests (`core/data/src/test`), among them `ContractTest`, `VectorsTest` and `WindowVectorsTest`, which run the web's shared
contract and vectors (`shared/`, docs/API.md); and `RoomScenariosTest` (`core/data`, repo), which replays the web room
controller's recorded scenarios (`shared/vectors/room.json`).

| `signup` | `UiFeaturesTest`: signing up logs you in; `ChirkleApiTest`: sign up | Covered |
| `session` | `UiFlowTest`: a wrong password says so; `ServicesTest`: logging out clears the session's data, and so does a session that ran out while the app was closed (QA BUG-145, web: `app.test.ts`) | Partial: a session revoked elsewhere, two sessions |
| `accounts` | `UiFeaturesTest`: renaming yourself | Partial: password change |
| `avatar` | — | Not yet (the photo picker can't be driven on Robolectric; changed by hand on the emulator, ANDROID.md §22.3) |
| `realtime` | `UiFlowTest`: a live message; `ServicesTest`, `ChirkleApiTest`: realtime events | Covered |
| `reconnect` | `ChirkleApiTest`: reconnect after a pause says events may have been missed | Partial: gap fill after it |
| `history` | `ServicesTest`: opens around a message far back, jumps to the latest | Partial: scrolling the edges |
| `unread` | `ServicesTest`: live counts, read on the server; `UiPortsTest`: unread rooms listed first, a folded section lists only them; `UiFeaturesTest`: what came while the app was in the background is read on coming back (QA BUG-157); `UiPortsTest`: opening a room reads only what is on screen, scrolling down the rest (ANDROID.md §25); `ServicesTest`: a read that fails is sent again by itself (QA BUG-162); `RoomSectionsTest` | Partial: the badge and the "New" line on screen |

| `room_access` | `UiFeaturesTest`: private with a member; `ChirkleApiTest` | Partial: who can post, Open Air |
| `attachments` | `UiPortsTest`: the viewer drops a message deleted while it is open (QA BUG-155); `CollectionsTest`: a sent file's shape (`file_dims`, DESIGN.md §17.5) | Partial: picking files (pickers; sent through the system picker by hand on the emulator, ANDROID.md §22.3; the outbox sends files: `Outbox`); `ImagePrepTest`: photos upright before re-encoding on Android 8 (QA BUG-164); downloads by hand on the emulator (QA BUG-161, ANDROID.md §26) |

| `cache` | `ServicesTest`: the room is kept for next time; a private room you are taken out of is kept empty (QA BUG-160); the room opened again from a link stays the active one (QA BUG-168) | Partial: opening from it |

| `xss` | `LinksTest`: only http(s) become links. Compose shows text as text: there is no HTML to inject | Covered |
| `a11y` | — | Not yet (content descriptions are set; no automated check, no TalkBack pass) |
| `mobile` | — | Not applicable: the web's narrow layout |
| `media` | `UiPortsTest`: a room's images in the grid, one opened in the viewer; an empty room says so | Partial: paging, video posters (on the emulator only) |
| `switcher` | `UiPortsTest`: Jump to finds a room by a word and opens it; `JumpTest`: the web's matching and ranking cases; `ServicesTest`: the last-open times are forgotten with the session (QA BUG-152) | Covered |

Between servers: `tests/integration/federation.test.ts` | Covered |
| — (Android only) | Servers and accounts (ANDROID.md §17): `AccountsTest`, `ServersTest` (add, switch, links and pushes find their account, refused sessions, addresses), `UiAccountsTest` (add an account on another server, switch from the account list opened by the brand, a bad address, log out to another account) | Covered |
| `notify` (web: while a tab is open, DESIGN.md §34) | Notifications of DMs and replies by a periodic check, no Google (ANDROID.md §21): `NotifyCheckTest` (DMs and replies once; every message of a room chosen in its menu, ANDROID.md §24; not other plain messages, from before sign-in, read elsewhere, hidden, on screen, the open room; a check failing part way loses nothing, QA BUG-153), `UiNotifyTest` (the worker's check posts them on their channels at their messages' times, takes a read one away; Notify of every message from the room's menu) | Covered; tried on the emulator (ANDROID.md §22.1).
